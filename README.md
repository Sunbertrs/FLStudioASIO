# FLStudioASIO

FL Studio ASIO source file.

---

The ASIO made by **FL Studio** is so better than ASIO4ALL.

In this ASIO, you can play the sound of DAW & the sound of third-party software **together**.

But in ASIO4ALL you can **only** play the sound of DAW.

So, if you want to play the sound of third-party software, you need to disable the sound device in **ASIO4ALL menu**.

---

**Usage:** Download this full project and run `registerAsioDriver.bat`.

Remove this ASIO driver just only need to run `unregisterAsioDriver.bat`.

---

**Warning:** This ASIO is a third-party ASIO, so it may be unstable.

**The best way to solve the problem of ASIO is** buy a new sound device with ASIO. If you are no able to buy a new one, just use this project.

Have a good time :-)
